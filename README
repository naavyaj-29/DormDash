#DormDash
DormDash is a peer-to-peer homemade meal network that helps students share culturally meaningful and affordable home-cooked meals on campus. It’s designed to support belonging, community, and accessibility through food.

##🚀 Inspiration

Many students, especially those far from home, from underrepresented backgrounds, or with dietary restrictions, struggle to find food that reflects their culture, fits their needs, or makes them feel connected on campus. DormDash reimagines food not just as nourishment, but as a path to community, identity, and belonging.

##🔍 User Research

**From interviews with 60+ students:**

83% miss home-cooked meals
